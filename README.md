Hospital-Charges
================

Program that asks user to enter specifics about hospital stay to calculate total hospital bill also uses overload function.
. First, the program will ask if the patient was admitted as an in-patient or an out-patient. If the patient was an in-patient, the following data should be entered:
•	The number of days spent in the hospital
•	The daily rate
•	Hospital medication charges
•	Charges for hospital services (lab test, etc)
The program will ask for the following data if the patient was an out-patient:
•	Charges for hospital services (lab test, etc)
•	Hospital medication charrges
The program will use two overloaded functions to calculate the total charges. One of the functions should accept arguments for the in-patient data, while the other function accepts arguments for out-patient information. Both functions will return the total charges.
